# Product Challenge: Build a Todo App for Solopreneurs with a Focus on “Care”

**Overview**
We’re building a todo app designed specifically for solopreneurs—founders wearing many hats who need a tool that supports them with empathy and thoughtful guidance. The founder has given us one guiding principle: **“care.”** This means the app should help users manage tasks gently, reduce overwhelm, and encourage progress with kindness.

**Important:**
It **doesn't matter what you build** — you can literally clone an existing todo app if you want. What matters most to us is **how you approach the problem**. We prefer you work **smart, not hard**, and show clear thinking, planning, and communication.

**AI Use:**
Using AI tools (like GPT or similar) during the challenge is totally fine—just be sure to clearly share how you used them in your process and what decisions you made yourself.

## Additional Context

To better understand the guiding principles and vision behind this project, please refer to the [FORM_INTAKE.md](./FORM_INTAKE.md) file. It contains a sample founder discovery form filled out by a business-savvy founder. This document will help you grasp the core user needs, product values, and business goals — all important to consider as you approach the challenge.

### What to Do

**1. Plan & Break Down Your Work**
Before writing code, spend some time breaking the project into clear, manageable tasks. Use whichever tool you prefer (GitHub Issues, Trello, Linear, or even a simple list). For each task:

* Write a clear title and description
* Estimate how long it will take (roughly)
* Note any dependencies or priorities

This helps us see how you approach work management and communication.

---

**2. Design or Choose a UI**
You can:

* Design your own simple interface, or
* Find an existing todo app UI online that you like and adapt it

Keep **care** front and center. The UI should feel warm, approachable, and reduce user stress. If you borrow a design, please credit the source.

---

**3. Build Core Features**
Implement the core todo app functionality:

* Add, edit, delete tasks
* Mark tasks as complete
* Persist data between sessions (localStorage is fine)
* Responsive layout (works on desktop and mobile)

---

**4. Innovate on UX**
Add or improve **one UX feature** that embodies the theme of care — something that makes the app feel supportive and empathetic for solopreneurs. This could be:

* Gentle task nudges and positive reinforcement messages
* Personalized daily check-ins or motivational prompts
* Task health indicators with friendly suggestions
* A “pause & reflect” mode for celebrating wins and managing overwhelm
* Any creative idea that fits the care philosophy

Document in a short paragraph:

* What you built
* Why you chose this feature
* How it improves the feeling of care and supports solopreneurs

---

**5. Document Your Work**
Include a README or similar document that covers:

* How to run your app
* Your task breakdown (link or pasted list)
* Key design and technical decisions
* How you used AI tools (if any) and your own input
* What you would improve or add next if you had more time

---

### It’s Okay If...

1. You don’t implement every feature perfectly — we care more about your approach and priorities.
2. Your UI isn’t pixel-perfect or pretty — as long as that one UX feature you highlight is thoughtful and well done.
3. You run out of time — just explain your thinking, trade-offs, and what you’d do next in your documentation.
4. You’re stronger in some areas than others — we’re not just hiring coders; we want well-rounded problem solvers and communicators.
5. You take creative liberties — show us how you think about product and user needs, even if it means bending the brief.
6. You document assumptions and questions instead of waiting for clarification — we value independent judgment.
7. Your code isn’t perfect — clean, readable, and maintainable code is great, but it doesn’t have to be flawless for this test.

---

### What’s Not Okay

* No task breakdown or planning submitted — we want to see how you think through and organize work, not just jump into code.
* No documentation or unclear explanations — if you don’t explain your choices, it’s hard for us to understand your thought process.
* Copy-pasting code without understanding — we expect you to understand and be able to explain whatever you submit.
* Ignoring the time limit — please don’t spend more than 2 hours on this. Quality over quantity matters.
* Incomplete or broken core functionality without explanation — if something isn’t working, let us know why and what you’d fix next.
* Disrespectful or unprofessional communication — we value kindness, clarity, and respect in all interactions.
* Delivering code that’s impossible to run or test — please ensure your submission works locally or on a live demo.

---

### Final Note

If you feel stuck or unsure, just follow your best instincts as a product developer. We want to see your problem-solving, your priorities, and how you communicate under uncertainty.

---

### Timeframe & Deliverables

* Please spend **up to 2 hours** on this challenge
* Deliver:

  * Code repository link (GitHub/GitLab)
  * Link to live demo if possible
  * Documentation as described above

---

### What We’re Looking For

* Clear task planning and communication
* Clean, maintainable code and sensible architecture
* Thoughtful UI/UX decisions focused on care and empathy
* Ability to innovate and explain your thinking clearly
* Comfort with async work and documenting your process
