# Founder Discovery Form — Project Intake

**Project Name:** CareTask — Task Management for Solopreneurs.

**Founder:** Jamie Lee.

**Date:** 2025-08-10.

**NOTE:** This document is hypothetical and meant to be used as a guiding principle. It is NOT a set of requirements or a product requirements document (PRD).


---

### 1. What’s the main guiding principle or keyword for your product?

> *Care.* I want this product to truly help solo founders who are overwhelmed by juggling everything. It should feel like a supportive companion, not just another productivity tool.

---

### 2. Who are your target users?

> Solo entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small business owners who wear multiple hats. They’re passionate but stretched thin, often working irregular hours and struggling to keep on top of tasks.

---

### 3. What business or market problem are you trying to solve?

> There’s a gap in the market for task apps that don’t just focus on features but on emotional support. Most tools are either too complex or too cold — they add stress rather than relieve it.
>
> I want something that helps people *feel cared for* while managing their work — encouraging progress without pressure or burnout.

---

### 4. What key values or qualities do you want this product to reflect?

* Empathy and understanding of user struggles
* Simplicity and ease of use — not overwhelming with too many options
* Flexibility — works with different work rhythms, not rigid schedules
* Warmth and encouragement, so users feel motivated and supported

---

### 5. Do you have specific feature requests or ideas?

> Honestly, I’m more focused on the problem than the solution.
>
> The app should cover basic task management — adding, editing, completing tasks — but beyond that, I want the team to come up with ways to *show care* through the experience.
>
> Whether that’s gentle reminders, motivational messages, or other thoughtful touches — I’m open.

---

### 6. What are your preferences or constraints regarding technology or design?

> I’m not technical, so I trust your expertise here. But I want the product to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use on both desktop and mobile.
>
> I care about privacy and want users to feel their data is safe.
>
> Also, if AI or automation can help make the experience more caring or personal, I’m interested — as long as it’s clear and transparent.

---

### 7. How do you want users to feel after using your app?

> I want users to feel supported, less overwhelmed, and more motivated to move forward — like the app is a helpful friend, not a strict taskmaster.

---

### 8. Anything else you want us to know?

> I want to build something meaningful, not just another app chasing features.
>
> The team should keep the user’s wellbeing at the heart of every decision.
>
> I’m excited to collaborate and am open to suggestions and iterations as we learn more.
